# PrefExtensions

Declarative extensions on SharedPreferences and Editor with the help of annotation processing.

This project is being continued at [PreferenceX](https://github.com/Glassdoor/PreferenceX)

## Use Case

Often times, SharedPreference getters and setters are non declarative and not the most readable. Typically, to get a value from SharedPreference, you do a variation of:

```kotlin
val sharedPreferences = context.getSharedPreferences("file_name", Context.MODE_PRIVATE)
val appStartCount = sharedPreferences.getLong("appStartCount", 0)
```

To insert a value, you do:
```kotlin
val editor = sharedPreferences.edit()
editor.putLong("appStartCount", 1)
```
This isn't the most readable API. Without reading the key, it's hard to know what we're going for. 

## Usage

PrefExtensions creates a readable API by generating extensions on `SharedPreferences` and `SharedPreferences.Editor`. The same example would be something like:

#### Declare your preference variable:
```kotlin
class MyPreferences {
  @Preference private val appStartCount: Long? = null
}
```

#### Get that value
```kotlin
// Or get from your favorite DI
val sharedPreferences = context.getSharedPreferences("file_name", Context.MODE_PRIVATE) 
val appStartCount = sharedPreferences.getAppStartCount() // Generated extension
```

#### Set the value
```kotlin
val editor = sharedPreferences.edit() // Or get from your favorite DI
editor.putAppStartCount(2) // Generated extension
```

## Default Values

SharedPreference reads require a default value to be given. You can easily define the default value for your given preference with an optional parameter:

```kotlin
@Preference(defaultLong = 1L) 
private val appStartCount: Long? = null

@Preference(defaultString = "hello world")
private val greetingText: String? = null
```

PrefExtensions also takes advantage of Kotlin's default values in parameters and the generated code creates an optional parameter in the getter. This is useful for one off-ing a different defaultValue than the one you provided in the annotation.

**Generated Code**
```kotlin
fun SharedPreferences.getAppStartCount(defaultValue: Long = 1): Long = getLong("appStartCount", defaultValue)
```

**Usage**
```kotlin
preferences.getAppStartCount(defaultValue = 20) 
```


## Custom Keys

PrefExtensions can be added incrementally into your project. If you already have a SharedPreference entry defined with a particular key that is not very reader friendly (like "app_launch_count"), you can easily define a custom key to your Preference declaration. 

Using this, you can continue to use the newer API in some cases, while still supporting access through the usual SharedPreference API.

```kotlin
@Preference(key = "app_launch_count") 
private val appStartCount: Long? = null
```
